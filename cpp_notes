virtual vs pure virtual

virtual: base class implement the function, derived class can override the function if needed but does not have to. Virtual 
functions called through base class pointers/references will be resolved at run-time. That is, the dynamic type of the object
is used instead of its static type:

pure virtual: an interface, base class provides an interface and must be implemented by derived class, or the derived class
becomes abstract too.
